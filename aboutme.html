        <p>I started my high school education in 2016.I joined St.claires girls boarding in Nakuru county school on february
            8th in 2016.During my stay at St.claires,i used to do well on my studies and i was involved 
            in many curriculum activities as well as co-curriculum activities.I was used a good player in football.
            But i didn't finish my high school there because of financial problems.I later joined RUNGIRI HIGH  
            SCHOOL which is a day school , in form three.I finished my form four and did my final exams and i did well.After 
            i had finished my high school education ,i used to stay at home.During the month of June one of my relatives that 
            my uncle told me about Moringa school.And now am learning</p>


        <p>I decided to learn about programming because <strong>(first) </strong> Am passionate about technology and ever since i was in 
        my childhood i wanted to be a web designer.<strong>(second) </strong> The world is going digital and everything in it is about 
    technology.<strong>(Third) </strong>Whatever am learning am able to put it into practice etc.</p>
